## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Figma
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I never did something like this before, and at first i thought about "do i have to put up a fully functionnal notifications system or it's just visual ?" and after thinking about it and coming to the conclusion that it cannot be done without some kind of database, i ended up realising that it was probably not what was asked of me. 
Still, this is a good base to port it at some point into a fully functionnal system.
